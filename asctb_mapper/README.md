# ASCTB-CT-Label-Mapper

Use the `ASCTB_Mapper_Tutorial.ipynb` notebook (based on the `asctb_ct_label_mapper` package) to ensure controlled vocabulary for annotations of scRNA-seq datasets: [docs](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/asctb-ct-label-mapper/tree/main).

> Briefly: The code essentially creates an initial report to show the `k`-closest ASCT+B Lung labels for each query CellType annotation/label.

Created the `Azimuth_CellTypist_PopV_Lung_ASCTB_Crosswalks.xlsx` file using the code as a starting point with closest-2 ASCT+B Lung labels, and received SME feedback (Gloria Pryhuber) to create the final usable `Azimuth_CellTypist_PopV_Lung_ASCTB_Crosswalks.csv`.
