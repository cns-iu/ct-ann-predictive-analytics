# Azimuth


Use the modular parameterized `azimuth_prediction_pipeline.R` script to generate Azimuth predictions. Transfers labels onto query RDS-dataset based on reference dataset anchors. Output can be configured to be CSV/RDS file.

Might need `Azimuth_convert_Rds_to_h5ad.R` for future downstream analytics.
